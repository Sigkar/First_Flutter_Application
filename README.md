# Its hoppin
This is honestly just a pet project to get deeper into Firebase. I need to write an API or at least some form of RTB to hook into this so that people can post and do other crazy stuff.

## Long term goals?
- Become a place for local craft beers to post themselves
- People can rate local craft beers
- Maybe also post food that goes well with these beers?
- Pick a radius and find the best beer nearby?
